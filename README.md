# Cardiovascular Monitor ðŸ©ºðŸ“·

A real-time cardiovascular monitoring system using a standard webcam and OpenCV.

This project extracts physiological signals from facial video â€” specifically the green channel intensity of the forehead region â€” to estimate cardiovascular metrics such as:

-  Heart Rate (BPM)  
-  SpO2 (Oxygen Saturation)  
-  Blood Pressure (simulated)  
-  Cardiovascular Load

## Features

âœ… Face and forehead region detection  
âœ… Real-time green channel data extraction  
âœ… 15-second data capture and analysis  
âœ… Visualization of estimated results (OpenCV window)  
âœ… All built with standard libraries â€” no external devices required

How It Works
A webcam feed is accessed using OpenCV.

The system detects the face and focuses on the forehead.

Green channel intensity (related to blood perfusion) is captured frame by frame.

Basic estimations of cardiovascular metrics are made based on the signal pattern.

Final results are displayed after the capture duration.
